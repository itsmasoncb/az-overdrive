# az-overdrive
Export amazon wishlist, parse ISBNs/ASINs, and use Libby API/Library Resources to search for books. Borrow instead of buy.

## Current State - 07.02.2024
az-parse-v2.py can take an amazon wishlist of books and return the ISBN10 and ISBN13 values in a list.

## Future State
Future updates will include automatic search across library resources via returned ISBNs and a yet undetermined method to filter out non-books and search audiobooks as well.
